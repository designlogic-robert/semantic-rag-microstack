Universal Semantic Systems (USS) is a semantic runtime stack for deterministic AI behavior. 
Core layers include:

- UST (Universal Semantic Token Model): canonical schema for semantic tokens.
- USR (Universal Semantic Runtime): planning, routing, and governance over semantic operations.
- USE (Universal Semantic Engine): core reasoning engine that executes plans.
- SynCE (domain engine): domain-specific cognition for applied use cases.
- SCP (Semantic Control Protocol): orchestration and control language for flows.
- ORCH-C (deterministic planner): central orchestrator that converts semantic tokens into execution plans.

This demo shows how USS concepts can be indexed with a RAG pipeline and queried through an API.
You can add more detailed notes here about ORCH-C, SCP, SynCE, and your architectural decisions.
